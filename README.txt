This script is still under development, use it at your own risk!!!

It will save only new files and shouldn't overwrite anything but make a backup of your data before trying it out just for safety.

To run, you need to go to Window, Python Editor. Open the script (second button on the toolbar) and press Execute Active Work Area (fifth button, with the little arrow.) It will ask for:

1) A scene with a single already characterized character. It can have any skeleton or nomenclature, it's just important to be already characterized, with or without a control rig;

2) A folder with .fbx animations on a 3ds max biped skeleton. They don't need to be characterized, but they need to be a 3ds max bip skeleton.

It will save each animation on folder 2 over folder 1.


TO IMPLEMENT:

. use FBBatch to load also other file formats
. choose the characterization method for the animation folder
. create a GUI
. maybe add characterization templates?
